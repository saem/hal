# HAL - Hypertext Application Language

Based on the Draft put out by [Mike Kelly](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html). I've created some basic structs that serialize correctly, at least for JSON to help creating compliant output. This is not a full opinionated implementation, just a little boost to help you along. Will probably be fleshed out further over time, as needed.
